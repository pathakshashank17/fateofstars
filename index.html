					# Fate of starsðŸ’«



					# Some facts


					Powered by fusion


					`$$ More\ massive\ \Longrightarrow \ Hotter\ \&\ Bluer $$`


					`$$ Lifetime\ \varpropto \ \frac{fM}{L} \ $$`
					`$$ fM\ =\ Reaction\ mass $$`
					`$$ L\ =\ Luminosity $$`



					## Beside Supernova, there are three possible endings to this saga



					# White Dwarf


					Stars less than 5M do not undergo supernova, just shed their shells, creating planetary nebula


					Very dense objects (only after black holes and neutron stars)


					Our sun's white dwarf will be 0.6M and about the size of Earth. 


					Stabilized by electron degeneracy pressure. 


					Stars with a mass of few orders of solar masses will form a C & O-based core. Fusion stops at carbon. 


					Stars of few solar masses have enough gravitational pressure to compress the core even more, forming Mg, Ne, Si, Fe via fusion. 


					If core mass exceeds the Chandrashekhar limit (1.4M generally), degeneracy pressure is not enough to support the core.
					
					
					The future of core can take two paths: The presence of heavier elements causes collapse into a neutron star (via K-capture) & the presence of higher core temperature favors an uncontrolled nuclear reaction, finally resulting in a supernova. 


					If the core respects the Chandrashekhar limit, then we have a stable core, which continues fusion and slowly dims over a long time, eventually forming a black dwarf (never observed). 



					# Neutron Star <!-- .slide: data-background-video="assets/pulse.mp4" data-background-video-loop data-background-video-muted -->


					Can be made via
					- White Dwarfs (<5M) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					- Supernova of supergiant stars (~30M) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
					

					Formed via K-capture in the stellar core.
					`$$ p\ +\ e^{-} \ \longrightarrow \ n $$`


					Neutron resists further compression by Pauli's exclusion principle & Strong nuclear force. 


					Made up of mainly Fe. 


					Have a fairly small radius (~10km), thus have extremely high rotation. (due to conservation of angular momentum). The fastest one rotates so fast that its surface speed is 0.24c. 


					Hypothesized that "flux-freezing" creates strong magnetic field and ejects strong beams of radiation. The ones whose beams align with Earth are called Pulsars. 


					Do not undergo any more changes (if left alone) and cool over time.

					# Black Hole <!-- .slide: data-background-iframe="https://lab.hakim.se/spiral/" -->


					If the mass of the neutron star approaches ~2M (Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit), then the gravity overcomes the strong nuclear force and degeneracy pressure, and it collapses into a black hole.


					The core collapses and becomes smaller than the Schwarzchild radius. (?)


					## Schwarzchild Radius


					##### `$$ Kinetic\ Energy\ +\ Potential\ Energy\ =0 $$`
					##### `$$ \Longrightarrow \ \frac{mv^{2}}{2} -\frac{GMm}{r} =0 $$` <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
					##### `$$ \Longrightarrow \ r=\frac{2GM}{v^{2}} $$` <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->
					##### `$$ Substituting\ v\ =\ c\ ( speed\ of\ light) $$` <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in-then-semi-out" -->


					##### `$$ r_{Schwartzchild} =\frac{2GM}{c^{2}} $$`


					It is currently unclear if it is possible for a core to collapse into a black hole directly, or it has to undergo the intermediate unstable neutron star stage. 


					Normally cannot be easily detected, but become visible when they feed on nearby stuff. The accretion disk becomes so hot that it radiates, thus in turn guiding us where the event horizon (?) of the black hole is.
